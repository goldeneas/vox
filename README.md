## Info
Vox is a prototype voxel game engine made in rust from scratch.\
I am working on this as a fun side project; any suggestions are very welcome!

## Current Status
Development is stalled; I am rewriting parts of the engine in a private repo.\
The reasoning behing this is that I did not have a good separation between the engine\
and the game part of this project.\
Feel free to explore around, though! Voxel rendering is quite fast with\
multi indirect, instanced drawing + greedy meshing.\

## Features
* Desktop Crossplatform (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
* Integration with Bevy's ECS for fast, multithreaded systems
* Integration with Glyphon and Egui for immediate UIs

## Planned
* Benchmark Tooling
* Basic 2D noise world generation
* ...
